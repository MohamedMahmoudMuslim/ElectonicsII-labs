### Audio Amplifier
The audio frequency spectrum is defined to be in the range of frequencies from 20
Hz to 20 kHz. The range of frequencies of the human voice is generally between
300 Hz and 3 kHz. In this project, it is required to implement an audio amplifier
system that consists of a pre-amplifier system followed by a power amplifier stage
to drive the speaker.
#### Simulate the op-amp audio amplifier using Multisim.
• Observe the signal voltages with the oscilloscope.
• Determine the voltage gain of the op-amp stage.
• Determine the overall voltage gain.
• Measure the frequency response of the system by using the Bode plotter.
• What is the voltage gain at 5 kHz in dB?
